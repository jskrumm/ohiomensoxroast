        <p>
            The fishing tournament at the Ox Roast is fun for all ages. Lasting most of the first day, the tournament gives you plenty
            of time to make memories with others who love fishing just as much as you. The tournament is for
            catfish, but there are other fish in the ponds as well. So if you enjoy fishing for bass or blue gill, you can do that too. Take
            advantage of this opportunity to reel in that big fish before the summer ends.
        </p>

            Fishing is from 8am to 3pm Friday. For more information about this event you can call Carl Levine at <a href="tel:+19372320064">937-232-0064</a>.
