                Mitchel Burch sings baritone and brings many years of Southern Gospel experience to the Townesmen. Mitch grew up in a musical,
                singing, and preaching family. This year he celebrates being in the pastoral and preaching ministry for 40 years and currently serves
                as the Lead Pastor of the Towne Boulevard Church of God. He loves the close harmonies and southern blend of the Townesmen
                sound. He has sung with several groups since his childhood, beginning with his family trio and New Sound Trio, Evening Light Trio,
                Diciples Quartet, Dayspring Quartet and Mercy River Quartet. Mitch was married to his wife Shelly of 36 years before she went
                home to be with the Lord in May of 2015. Mitch has two children Andrew and Meagan and he currently resides in Middletown,

                The Townesmen is a group that has been in existence for many years. Started by four laymen in a local church to sing for its services.
                Now after 50 years the group is made up of four people who are long time servants of the church, three serving as worship leaders,
                and one serving as a senior pastor.
